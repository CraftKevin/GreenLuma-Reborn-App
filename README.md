# What is GreenLuma Reborn ?
GreenLuma Reborn (GLR) is a Steam unlocker made by Steam006 that is used to obtain games from family shared libraries and DLC for games. There's much more to it, though.

# Can I get banned for using GreenLuma Reborn ?
There will always be a risk when using GLR. If you're willing to take that risk, go right on ahead. If not, then don't bother. Especially when that risk means the status of your Steam account.

As expected, there are some games that blacklist GLR and using it will result in receiving a game ban. Refer to [this page](https://github.com/linkthehylian/GreenLuma-Reborn-App/wiki/Blacklist) if you want to check what games NOT to play.

Please keep in mind. Like CreamAPI, GreenLuma Reborn **does not** work for every game.

Also, keep in mind that not **every game** is available to play through Steam family sharing.

I **highly advise** you to follow the "Legit stealth mode" installation instructions if you do plan on using GreenLuma Reborn.

# Is GreenLuma Reborn better than SteamCrack and CreamAPI ?
~~My personal opinion ? Yes, TONS better.~~

GLR is still a very unique tool because of what it's able to do, especially the unintended feature of bypassing family sharing restrictions. But I hardly ever use it anymore unless I actually plan on playing a game from a friend's library.

[SteamCrack](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1383930) works like GreenLuma Reborn from what I've heard. Unfortunately, it requires you to downgrade your Steam client, not to mention it's incredibly unstable and it will crash Steam completely if someone messages you.

[CreamAPI](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576) is a DLC unlocker for legitimately owned Steam games. Everything is done through a .ini file since the Steam API is modified. I use CreamAPI for some single player games and others. Although, it doesn't work for [*every*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVNjbkzGFsfeszDx-psLTm7Qe67nvEh2vlWpUPGnYdA/edit#gid=0) game.

# What can I do with your app ?
You can:

*  Link your Steam folder to add new app IDs.
*  Keep track of your app IDs with their own descriptions.
*  Effortlessly remember the last app ID you added. (*The app does it automatically.*)
*  Simultaneously add/edit both your app IDs along with their descriptions.
*  Allows you to delete any app ID's text file along with its description.

# Where can I download your app ?
All stable releases can be found [here](https://github.com/linkthehylian/GreenLuma-Reborn-App/releases).

# Any viruses/malware ?
I can assure you it is 100% [virus free](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/5d12065235e836b313c2009df0af8ad83ced7c4db958d46ca33a18d1d06b7b02/detection).

# Why does the program automatically have Administrative privileges ?
In order for literally any program to access or modify files in Program Files/Program Files (x86). Administrative privileges are required.

# Will more features be added soon ?
Most definitely, I'm just adding what I can at the moment. If you have any suggestions you can contact me.
