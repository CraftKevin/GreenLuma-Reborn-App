# Latest update: **[GreenLuma Reborn 1.7.3](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=80797)**

To make things easier, I'll keep the download link updated for anyone who wants the latest version of GLR.

[Download GreenLuma Reborn 1.7.3](https://www104.zippyshare.com/v/BFkVBCRf/file.html)

(If the link above is not updated to the current version of GLR, I'm probably not home and will make sure that it's updated ASAP.)

The "DllInjector.ini" in the download link has already been modified by me to automatically include NoHook mode. Just follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/linkthehylian/GreenLuma-Reborn-App/wiki/FaQ#can-i-get-banned-for-using-greenluma-reborn-) and skip step three and four. **Do not** edit it.
