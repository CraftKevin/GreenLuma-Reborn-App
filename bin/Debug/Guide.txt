GreenLuma Reborn App (GLRApp) - Guide

Some things to note:

-PLEASE extract this tool from the 7Zip/Winrar archive into a folder.
-Make sure you've already installed GreenLuma Reborn before using this tool. Or else the "AppList" folder will not exist in your Steam directory until it is.
-GreenLuma Reborn only supports up to 95 text files that contain App IDs. Which starts at 0.
-The main purpose of my tool is to provide descriptions for App IDs so that you're able to keep track of what you've added.
-Administrative privileges are required in order to use this tool.
-Every App ID's description is located in the "AppList" folder in your Steam directory.

How to use:

1. Open GLRApp. (Administrative privileges are required)
2. Find the "App ID" text box.
3. Enter the App ID of a game/DLC that you would like to add.
4. Once it's entered, click "Save" and it'll give you the option to set a description.
5. If you clicked "Yes", move on to #6. If you clicked "No". You're done! Do this for as many App IDs as you'd like.
6. The Description window should've popped up. You can set a description for this specific App ID so that you know what it is later on. Once you've set a description, click "Set".
7. You're done! You can do this for as many App IDs as you'd like.


Lastly, I hope this tool has helped you! Thank you for using it!
