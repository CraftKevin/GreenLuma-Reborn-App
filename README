> **What is GreenLuma Reborn ?** 

GreenLuma Reborn (GLR) is a Steam crack made by Steam006 that is used to obtain DLC for legit owned Steam games. There is much more to it, though.

>  **Can I get banned for using GreenLuma Reborn ?**

~~I can't say: "No." as I don't know for sure. But, the chances are very low as long as you don't tell anyone who is affiliated with Valve.~~

There will always be a risk when using GLR.

My only highly recommended suggestion is that you don't use GLR to play games that use Unreal Engine that also use EasyAntiCheat (EAC).

>  **Is GreenLuma Reborn better than SteamCrack and CreamAPI ?**

My personal opinion ? Yes, TONS better.

[SteamCrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDlz5ykg1Qc) works like GreenLuma Reborn from what I've heard. Unfortunately, it's incredibly unstable and it will crash Steam completely if someone messages you.

[CreamAPI](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576) is a DLC unlocker for legitimately owned games. Like GreenLuma Reborn. However, everything is done through a .ini file. I use CreamAPI for some single player games and others. Although, it doesn't work for [*every*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVNjbkzGFsfeszDx-psLTm7Qe67nvEh2vlWpUPGnYdA/edit#gid=0) game.

> **What can I do with the GLRApp ?** 

You can:

*  Link your Steam folder to add new App IDs.
*  Keep track of your App IDs with their own descriptions.
*  Effortlessly remember the last App ID you added. (*The app does it automatically.*)
*  Simultaneously add/edit both your App IDs along with their descriptions.
*  Allows you to delete any App ID's text file along with its description.

>  **Where can I download your app ?**

>  **Any viruses/malware ?**

I can assure you it is 100% [virus free](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/5d12065235e836b313c2009df0af8ad83ced7c4db958d46ca33a18d1d06b7b02/detection).

>  **Why does the program automatically have Administrator privileges ?**

In order for literally any program to access or modify files in Program Files/Program Files (x86). Administrative privileges are required.

>  **Will more features be added soon ?**

Most definitely, I'm just adding what I can at the moment. If you have any suggestions you can contact me.
