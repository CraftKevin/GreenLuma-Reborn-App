> **What is GreenLuma Reborn ?** 

GreenLuma Reborn (GLR) is a Steam crack that is used to obtain DLC for legit owned Steam games. There is [*much more*](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=80797) to it, though.

>  **Can I get banned for using GreenLuma Reborn ?**

~~Unless you're stupid enough to email Valve that you're using a Steam crack. I'm 100% certain that they could care less.~~

I can't say: "No." as I don't know for sure. But, the chances are very low as long as you don't tell anyone who is affiliated with Valve.

> **What can I do with the GLRApp ?** 

You can:

*  Link your Steam folder to add new App IDs.
*  Keep track of your App IDs with their own descriptions.
*  Effortlessly remember the last App ID you added. (*The app does it automatically.*)

>  **Where can I download your app ?**

All releases can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/linkthehylian/glrapp/tags).

Refer to the changelog [here](https://gitlab.com/linkthehylian/glrapp/wikis/Changelog).

>  **Any viruses/malware ?**

I can assure you it is 100% [virus free](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/5d12065235e836b313c2009df0af8ad83ced7c4db958d46ca33a18d1d06b7b02/detection).

>  **Why does the program automatically have Administrator privileges ?**

In order for literally any program to access or modify files in Program Files/Program Files (x86). Administrative privileges are required.

>  **Will more features be added soon ?**

Most definitely, I'm just adding what I can at the moment. If you have any suggestions you can contact me.
